##libris


Libris is primarily a broad and ongoing project with inexorable scope creep that serves as a training ground for honing my skills in Javascript and general web technology.

Secondarily, it is the kernel of a product I believe in;
- a kind of combination of [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) 
- or a sort of [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) for books?
- A multi-platform toolbox for the researcher, student, conspiracy theorist or leisure reader.

Stay tuned for a feature roadmap!
